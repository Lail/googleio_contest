## Want To Go To Google I/O? Of Course You Do!

Google's annual developer conference is one of the most sought after tech events in the world. Year after year, Google does awesome things at I/O, not least of which is hooking all the attendees up with awesome Google SWAG. Not sold on Google I/O? You should be. Almost every Developer in the world wants to be there.

This year, we want to send you, so listen up. We've dreamed up an awesome challenge for you developers out there. We're going to give you a data set from our internal software (lovingly dubbed SWOOP, standing for Startup Weekend Operations and Organizers Portal) and documentation to play with. And...as you know, Google has a ton of tools for Developers...(start here, https://developers.google.com/products/) See where we're going? We want you to build something awesome using SWOOP and at least 1 Google platform (not just hosting or storage), and we'll pick the 4 best creations and send those 4 people to Google I/O.

We're pretty open here: It could be something fun or silly, something really useful, or just something you wish we had. There are a lot of cool ways to leverage Google Developer Tools, so coupled one of the largest collections of startup events in the world, the mind should be off and running with ways to pair the two to make something beautiful. If you want help brainstorming, just start asking our community, we'll help you get your question out there. (Tweet using the hashtag #swgoogleio)

To show us your creation, send us whatever information we will need to experience it, and, if you really want the best shot at winning, make a video explaining it and upload it here. If you can garner any votes from our fans on Facebook, we'll take that into consideration in our selection. If you choose not to make a video, you still need to submit an entry here on Facebook, instead of a video, you can select an image.

As if you needed it, here is another potential incentive: We're hiring a Web Developer, so if you're looking for a job, want a great head start in the interview process, and oh yeah, want to go get a bunch of free stuff from Google, this is for you.
